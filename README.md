# MAL-Saber-Custom

A modular version of the MAL Saber theme.

MAL Saber Custom. CSS’s contents are what are pasted into MAL's theme settings.

The theme is modular, edit variables in the labeled section. Use either the images that come with the CSS, images in the release section, or make your own.

Alternate images for theme variations will be uploaded to releases overtime ( https://github.com/marat569/MAL-Saber-Custom/releases )

If you have a servant suggestion you want to be used with this theme, create an "issue" post and I’ll try to get to it. Providing the image you want on top + color scheme would be a huge plus. Create new issue: https://github.com/marat569/MAL-Saber-Custom/issues/new
